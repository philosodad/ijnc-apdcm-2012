\begin{thm}
  Algorithm~\ref{alg:dgmm} (DGMM) will generate a 2-optimal cover in $O(log \Delta)$ communication rounds with high probability\footnote{The probability in this case is dependent on a fair coin toss. For the algorithm to solve in $O(\log{\Delta})$ rounds, the coins in a neighborhood should have a normal distribution, I.E., any given group of coins should have about the same number of heads as tails, and in any given neighborhood in any round, we should have about an equal number of inviters and receivers.} on random input.
