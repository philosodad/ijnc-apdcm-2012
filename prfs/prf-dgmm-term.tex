\begin{thm}
  Algorithm~\ref{alg:dgmm} (DMMW) will generate a 2-optimal cover in $O(\Delta)$ communication rounds with high probability on any input.
\label{thm:dgmm-term}
\end{thm}
\begin{smy}
We show first that our algorithm conducts the same steps in the same order as a sequential algorithm that is known to produce a 2-optimal result, next that the algorithm will terminate in $O(\Delta)$ communication rounds.
\end{smy}

\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:dgmm-term}]
\label{prf:correct}

\input{proofs/lem-dgmm-edge.tex}

\input{proofs/lem-dgmm-delta.tex}
Therefore, because DMMW weights all edges and assigns nodes to the cover in a manner equivalent to GMM in $O(\Delta)$ communication rounds, Theorem~\ref{thm:dgmm-term} is proved.
\end{proof}
