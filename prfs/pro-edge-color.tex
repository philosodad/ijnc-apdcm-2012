\begin{proof}
We first show that Algorith~\ref{alg:edge-color} terminates in $O(\Delta)$ rounds.

\input{prfs/lemma-edge-color-terminate.tex}
We will now show that the coloring produced by Algorithm~\ref{alg:edge-color} is guaranteed to be correct.
\input{prfs/lemma-edge-color-correct.tex}
We now show that the coloring produced by Algorithm~\ref{alg:edge-color} can be no worse than $2\Delta - 1$ in the worst case.
\input{prfs/lemma-edge-color-approximate.tex}
Therefore, Theorem~\ref{thm:edge-color} is correct.
\end{proof}
