\begin{ldef}
The active degree of a node $u$ is the number of unweighted edges of $u$ indicated by $\alpha(u)$. $\alpha(u)$ is either 0 for committed nodes or equal to the number of active neighbors of $u$ for active nodes.
\end{ldef}
\begin{ldef}
$\delta$ is the largest active degree in the graph.
\end{ldef}
