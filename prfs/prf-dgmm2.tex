The sequential version of Algorithm~\ref{alg:dgmm} has been shown to be 2-approximate for any ordering of edges. The distributed version can never select contiguous edges in a single round, as each node can form at most one partnership in a round. Because The simultaneous selection of vertexes to join the cover based on disjoint edges is exactly equivalent to the sequential selection of vertexes by selecting each edge under consideration in turn.\footnote{This algorithm could therefore also be used to provide an edge coloring in approximately the same time, equivalent to a greedy linear algorithm.}
