Distributed edge coloring is a well studied problem. Panconesi and collaborators have produced a number of papers tying edge coloring to channel assignment and presenting novel edge coloring algorithms with communication complexity of as low as $O(log{log{n}})$ \cite{Grable:1997:NOD:314161.314266},\cite{Panconesi:1997:RDE:249364.249368},\cite{1041515},\cite{982945}.

Gandham et al. present an deterministic algorithm which colors a graph using $\Delta + 1$ colors with a time complexity of $2\Delta + 1$ for acyclic graphs \cite{1498534}. Barenboim et al. present a deterministic algorithm which extends beyond trees and provides an $O(\Delta)$ coloring in $O(\Delta^{1 + \epsilon)}$ time for an arbitrarily small constant $\epsilon \le 1$ \cite{Barenboim:2011:DDE:1993806.1993825}. A limitation of this algorithm is that the constant factor for quality increases as $\epsilon$ decreases.

In strong edge coloring, Barret et al. present algorithms with running times dependent on the size of the graph $n$ \cite{1598948}. Kanj et al. show tight bounds for the quality and locality, but not the time bounds, of their algorithms \cite{Kanj:2009:LAE:1696884.1696902}.
