\label{sec:dimaed-correct}
We here address the termination, correctness, and solution quality of Algorithm~\ref{alg:edge-color}. We will first show that Algorithm~\ref{alg:edge-color} is likely to terminate in $O(\Delta)$ rounds, then that it will produce a correct coloring if it does terminate, and finally that the coloring produced will use no more than $2\Delta - 1$ colors.
