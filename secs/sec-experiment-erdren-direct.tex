50 Erdos-Renyi graphs of 200 and 400 nodes were constructed with an average degree of 4 and 8. The averaged results showed that the graphs with 400 nodes were solved in almost identical time, with any variance easily attributable to a slightly higher average $\Delta$. The degree of increase in the number of rounds required to create a correct distance two coloring was also consistent with the increase in $\Delta$.
