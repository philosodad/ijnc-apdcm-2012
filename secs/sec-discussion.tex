In sequential algorithms, there are a number of techniques--such as divide and conquer, linear programming, dynamic programming--that can be generalized to tackle a large number of problems. Distributed algorithms have a shorter history and a shorter list of such general techniques. In this paper, we have presented a general framework that can be used to tackle problems that can be mapped to matchings on a graph. We have applied this framework to three separate problems in graph theory.

Our application of the framework resulted in a new distributed algorithm for the Minimum Weighted Vertex Cover based on maximal matchings. The previous lower bound for this problem was $O(\log n)$ with high probability, we have shown that our algorithm improves this to $O(\log \Delta)$ for random graphs.
