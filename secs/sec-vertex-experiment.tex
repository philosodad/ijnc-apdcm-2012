In order to test our performance predictions, we designed a simulator to implement our algorithm (DGMM) and the algorithm of Koufoganiakkis and Young (K/Y). We generated random weighted graphs for $n=120, n=240, n=480, \text{and } n=960$, with average degrees of 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 96. 50 graphs were generated for each combination of sizes and average degree, for a total of 1200 graphs. DGMM and K/Y were used to produce a vertex cover for each graph, and the total weight and number of communication rounds were tallied and averaged for each of the 24 graph sizes. Our results showed that DGMM produced covers of approximately the same weight as K/Y in significantly fewer communication rounds in each case. Figures~\ref{plt:dgmm-comp} and \ref{plt:mwvc-rn} show our experimental results.

In Figure~\ref{plt:dgmm-comp}, the results for both algorithms are nearly identical, indicating that both algorithms found essentially the same covers for the input graphs. In Figure~\ref{plt:mwvc-rn}, the lower 4 curves indicate the number of rounds required to resolve DGMM, and the upper four the number of rounds required to resolve K/Y. The logarithmic growth confirms our experimental predictions, while the minor differences between different input sizes are accounted for by the variation in degree between larger and smaller random graphs.
