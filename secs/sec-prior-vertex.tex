Sequential Linear time algorithms for covering problems are surveyed in detail in \cite{254190}. The seminal paper on Linear Programming techniques for constant ratio approximation of MWVC was published by Bar-Yehuda and Even in 1981 \cite{Bar-Yehuda:1981lr}. Gonzalez created a 2-approximate LP-Free linear time algorithm based on Maximal Matching in 1995 which is the basis of our distributed algorithm \cite{Gonzalez1995129}. 

We are aware of three prior distributed algorithms for minimum weighted vertex cover. Grandoni et. al present a 2-approximate algorithm based on maximal matching in 2008\cite{1435381}. This algorithm uses $O(\log n + \hat{W})$ communication rounds, where $\hat{W}$ is the average vertex weight, and $n$ is the number of vertexes. {\AA}strand and Suomela presented a $O(\Delta + \hat{W})$ deterministic algorithm in 2010 which is also 2-approximate. Koufogiannakis and Young present a simpler $O(\log n)$ algorithm in 2009 \cite{1582746}. 

Parnas and Ron argue in 2007 that the growth of a randomized algorithm for solving MWVC in a message passing model is linear with the average degree of the graph\cite{Parnas:2007:AMV:1280283.1280327}. Following that work, Onak, Ron, Rosen and Rubinfeld present a deterministic algorithm that is 2-approximate in $O(\delta)$ time, where $\delta$ is the average degree of the graph\cite{Onak:2012:NSA:2095116.2095204}.
