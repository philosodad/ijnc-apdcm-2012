300 scale-free graphs were generated with either 100 or 400 nodes, with alterations in weighting to create increasingly disparate graphs. Algorithm~\ref{alg:edge-color} was used to generate an edge coloring for each graph.

As expected, rounds increased with Delta at what appears to be a constant rate. Interestingly, in contrast to our results on random graphs, on scale-free graphs we did not use more than $\Delta$ colors to color any of the generated graphs.

Figure~\ref{plt:scale-free-ec} shows our results for Experiment~\ref{sub:experiment:scalefree}.
