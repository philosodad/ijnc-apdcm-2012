	Abstract = {We give a nearly optimal sublinear-time algorithm for approximating the size of a minimum vertex cover in a graph G. The algorithm may query the degree deg(v) of any vertex v of its choice, and for each 1 ≤ i ≤ deg(v), it may ask for the ith neighbor of v. Letting VCopt(G) denote the minimum size of vertex cover in G, the algorithm outputs, with high constant success probability, an estimate [EQUATION] such that [EQUATION], where ε is a given additive approximation parameter. We refer to such an estimate as a (2, ε)-estimate. The query complexity and running time of the algorithm are {\~O}([EQUATION] · poly(1/ε)), where d denotes the average vertex degree in the graph. The best previously known sublinear algorithm, of Yoshida et al. (STOC 2009), has query complexity and running time O(d4/ε2), where d is the maximum degree in the graph. Given the lower bound of Ω(d) (for constant ε) for obtaining such an estimate (with any constant multiplicative factor) due to Parnas and Ron (TCS 2007), our result is nearly optimal.

In the case that the graph is dense, that is, the number of edges is Θ(n2), we consider another model, in which the algorithm may ask, for any pair of vertices u and v, whether there is an edge between u and v. We show how to adapt the algorithm that uses neighbor queries to this model and obtain an algorithm that outputs a (2, ε)-estimate of the size of a minimum vertex cover whose query complexity and running time are {\~O}(n) · poly(1/ε).},

	Abstract = {For a given graph G over n vertices, let OPT"G denote the size of an optimal solution in G of a particular minimization problem (e.g., the size of a minimum vertex cover). A randomized algorithm will be called an @a-approximation algorithm with an additive error for this minimization problem if for any given additive error parameter @e>0 it computes a value OPT@? such that, with probability at least 2/3, it holds that OPT"G@?OPT@?@?@a@?OPT"G+@en. Assume that the maximum degree or average degree of G is bounded. In this case, we show a reduction from local distributed approximation algorithms for the vertex cover problem to sublinear approximation algorithms for this problem. This reduction can be modified easily and applied to other optimization problems that have local distributed approximation algorithms, such as the dominating set problem. We also show that for the minimum vertex cover problem, the query complexity of such approximation algorithms must grow at least linearly with the average degree d@? of the graph. This lower bound holds for every multiplicative factor @a and small constant @e as long as d@?=O(n/@a). In particular this means that for dense graphs it is not possible to design an algorithm whose complexity is o(n).},

	Abstract = {The paper presents distributed and parallel $\delta$-approximation algorithms for covering problems, where $\delta$ is the maximum number of variables on which any constraint depends (for example, $\delta$ = 2 for VERTEX COVER).

Specific results include the following.

For WEIGHTED VERTEX COVER, the first distributed 2-approximation algorithm taking O(log n) rounds and the first parallel 2-approximation algorithm in RNC. The algorithms generalize to covering mixed integer linear programs (CMIP) with two variables per constraint ($\delta$ = 2).

For any covering problem with monotone constraints and submodular cost, a distributed $\delta$-approximation algorithm taking $O(\log{2} |C|)$ rounds, where $|C|$ is the number of constraints. (Special cases include CMIP, facility location, and probabilistic (two-stage) variants of these problems.)

	Annote = {Grandoni et al. provide a logarithmic time algorithm for computing the weighted vertex cover in a distributed manner. Their approach is to expand each vertex in the graph into $W$ vertexes, where $W$ is the weight of the vertex. These expanded vertexes are used to create a meta-graph, with the expanded vertexes of each edge connected to each other. A maximal matching is calculated on this meta-graph. If all of the expanded vertexes of an original vertex have an edge in the meta-graph matching, the vertex is placed in the cover.

Because the number of expanded vertexes is dependent on weight, the matching will tend to prefer the lower weight nodes. In the paper, this intuition is formalized and it is proven that the method will generate better than 2-approximate solutions for weighted vertex cover.},

	Abstract = {We study the edge-coloring problem in the message-passing model of distributed computing. This is one of the most fundamental problems in this area. Currently, the best-known deterministic algorithms for (2Δ-1)-edge-coloring requires O(Δ) + log* n time [23], where Δ is the maximum degree of the input graph. Also, recent results of [5] for vertex-coloring imply that one can get an O(Δ)-edge-coloring in O(Δµ" log n) time, and an O(Δ1 + µ)-edge-coloring in O(log Δ log n) time, for an arbitrarily small constant µ > 0.

In this paper we devise a significantly faster deterministic edge-coloring algorithm. Specifically, our algorithm computes an O(Δ)-edge-coloring in O(Δµ) + log* n time, and an O(Δ1 + µ)-edge-coloring in O(log Δ) + log* n time. This result improves the state-of-the-art running time for deterministic edge-coloring with this number of colors in almost the entire range of maximum degree Δ. Moreover, it improves it exponentially in a wide range of Δ, specifically, for 2{\copyright}(log* n) ≤ Δ ≤ polylog(n). In addition, for small values of Δ (up to log1 - ? n, for some fixed Δ > 0) our deterministic algorithm outperforms all the existing randomized algorithms for this problem.

On our way to these results we study the vertex-coloring problem on graphs with bounded neighborhood independence. This is a large family of graphs, which strictly includes line graphs of r-hypergraphs (i.e., hypergraphs in which each hyperedge contains r or less vertices) for r = O(1), and graphs of bounded growth. We devise a very fast deterministic algorithm for vertex-coloring graphs with bounded neighborhood independence. This algorithm directly gives rise to our edge-coloring algorithms, which apply to general graphs.

Our main technical contribution is a subroutine that computes an O(Δ/p)-defective p-vertex coloring of graphs with bounded neighborhood independence in O(p2) + log* n time, for a parameter p, 1 d p d Δ. In all previous efficient distributed routines for m-defective p-coloring the product m {\AA} p is super-linear in Δ. In our routine this product is linear in Δ, and this enables us to speed up the coloring drastically.},

	Abstract = {Packet-scheduling is a particular challenge in wireless networks due to interference from nearby transmissions. A distance-2 interference model serves as a useful abstraction here, and we study packet routing and scheduling under this model. The main focus of our work is the development of fully-distributed (decentralized) protocols. We present polylogarithmic/constant factor approximation algorithms for various families of disk graphs (which capture the geometric nature of wireless-signal propagation), as well as near-optimal approximation algorithms for general graphs. The packet-scheduling work by L eighton, Maggs and Rao (Combinatorica, 1994) and a basic distributed coloring procedure, originally due to Luby (J. Computer and System Sciences, 1993), underlie many of our algorithms. Experimental work of Finocchi, Panconesi, and Silvestri (SODA 2002) showed that a natural modification of Luby's algorithm leads to improved performance, and a rigorous explanation of this was left as an open question; we prove that the modified algorithm is provably better in the worst-case. Finally, using simulations, we study the impact of the routing strategy and the choice of parameters on the performance of our distributed algorithm for unit disk graphs.},

	Abstract = { We conduct an experimental analysis of a distributed randomized algorithm for edge coloring simple undirected graphs. The algorithm is extremely simple yet, according to the probabilistic analysis, it computes nearly optimal colorings very quickly [Grable and Panconesi 1997]. We test the algorithm on a number of random as well as nonrandom graph families.The test cases were chosen based on two objectives: (i) to provide insights into the worst-case behavior (in terms of time and quality) of the algorithm and (ii) to test the performance of the algorithm with instances that are likely to arise in practice. Our main results include the following:(1) The empirical results obtained compare very well with the recent empirical results reported by other researchers [Durand et al. 1994, 1998; Jain and Werth 1995].(2) The empirical results confirm the bounds on the running time and the solution quality as claimed in the theoretical paper. Our results show that for certain classes of graphs the algorithm is likely to perform much better than the analysis suggests.(3) The results demonstrate that the algorithm might be well suited (from a theoretical as well as practical standpoint) for edge coloring graphs quickly and efficiently in a distributed setting.Based on our empirical study, we propose a simple modification of the original algorithm with substantially improved performance in practice.

	Annote = {This is the simplest possible algorithm for solving this problem in a distributed fashion. The algorithm consists of three steps. First, all uncolored edges choose a random color. Then all edges check for conflicts. Those that conflict release their color, those that do not become colored edges. This process is repeated until the algorithm runs out of colors or uncolored edges.

The authors test this algorithm as well as a modified version that can add colors to its palette, against several types of graphs. They find that the modified algorithm performs well overall. },

	Abstract = {Certain types of routing, scheduling, and resource-allocation problems in a distributed setting can be modeled as edge-coloring problems. We present fast and simple randomized algorithms for edge coloring a graph in the synchronous distributed point-to-point model of computation. Our algorithms compute an edge coloring of a graph $G$ with $n$ nodes and maximum degree $\Delta$ with at most $1.6 \Delta + O(\log^{1+ \delta} n)$ colors with high probability (arbitrarily close to 1) for any fixed $\delta > 0$; they run in polylogarithmic time. The upper bound on the number of colors improves upon the $(2 \Delta - 1)$-coloring achievable by a simple reduction to vertex coloring.
To analyze the performance of our algorithms, we introduce new techniques for proving upper bounds on the tail probabilities of certain random variables. The Chernoff--Hoeffding bounds are fundamental tools that are used very frequently in estimating tail probabilities. However, they assume stochastic independence among certain random variables, which may not always hold. Our results extend the Chernoff--Hoeffding bounds to certain types of random variables which are not stochastically independent. We believe that these results are of independent interest and merit further study.},

	Abstract = {Coloring the nodes of a graph with a small number of colors is one of the most fundamental problems in theoretical computer science. In this paper, we study graph coloring in a distributed setting. Processors of a distributed system are nodes of an undirected graph G. There is an edge between two nodes whenever the corresponding processors can directly communicate with each other. We assume that distributed coloring algorithms start with an initial m-coloring of G. In the paper, we prove new strong lower bounds for two special kinds of coloring algorithms. For algorithms which run for a single communication round---i.e., every node of the network can only send its initial color to all its neighbors---, we show that the number of colors of the computed coloring has to be at least $\Omega(\Delta2/log2 \Delta+ log log m)$. If such one-round algorithms are iteratively applied to reduce the number of colors step-by-step, we prove a time lower bound of $\Omega(\Delta/log2 \Delta+ log*m)$ to obtain an $O(\Delta)$-coloring. The best previous lower bounds for the two types of algorithms are $\Omega(log log m)$ and $\Omega(log*m)$, respectively.

	Annote = {This is a greatly cited paper that places an lower bound on the running time of a class of distributed iterative coloring algorithms. These algorithms start by coloring the graph with $q$ colors, where $q$ is some number larger than $\Delta$. The authors show that there exists an algorithm which can produce a $q-coloring$ in a single round. After this coloring is produced, the method is to iteratively reduce the number of colors in the graph until reaching $O(\Delta)$. 

The paper uses as a fundamental tool of analysis the concept of a "neighborhood graph". The Lifetime Dependency Graph presented in \cite{IPDPS.2008.45361} is a similar but more specialized structure that builds dependencies between solutions, rather than dependencies between local neighborhoods.

The information gathering potential across the neighborhood graph forms the lower bound for deterministic algorithm. This bound is tested by a random algorithm. The authors prove the probability that a random algorithm could generate an $O(\Delta)$ coloring in a single round.},

	Abstract = {We consider the problem of link scheduling in a sensor network employing a TDMA MAC protocol. Our link scheduling algorithm involves two phases. In the first phase, we assign a color to each edge in the network such that no two edges incident on the same node are assigned the same color. We propose a distributed edge coloring algorithm that needs at most ( delta;+1) colors, where delta; is the maximum degree of the graph. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first distributed algorithm that can edge color a graph with at most ( delta;+1) colors. In the second phase, we map each color to a unique timeslot and attempt to identify a direction of transmission along each edge such that the hidden terminal and the exposed terminal problems are avoided. Next, considering topologies for which a feasible solution does not exist, we obtain a direction of transmission for each edge using additional timeslots, if necessary. Finally, we show that reversing the direction of transmission along every edge leads to another feasible direction of transmission. Using both the transmission assignments we obtain a TDMA MAC schedule, which enables two-way communication between every pair of neighbors. For acyclic topologies, we show that at most 2( delta;+1) timeslots are required. Through simulations we show that for sparse graphs with cycles the number of timeslots assigned is close to 2( delta;+1).},
