\begin{abstract}
We present an automata for a compute node in a message passing model which allows a distributed computer to approximate solutions for three NP-Complete graph problems. Our algorithm for the Vertex Cover Problem uses $O(\log{\Delta)}$ communication rounds to find a 2-approximate solution. Our edge coloring algorithm is also 2-approximate and resolves in $O(\Delta)$ rounds, and we find a correct strong edge coloring of a symmetric digraph in $O(\Delta)$ rounds. All three algorithms require only one hop information to find correct solutions.

\section{Introduction}

In this paper we'll show the automata itself, then our results for vertex cover and edge color.

\subsection{Definitions}

In this subsection we'll define the problem.

\subsection{Prior Work}

Sequential Linear time algorithms for covering problems are surveyed in detail in \cite{254190}. The seminal paper on Linear Programming techniques for constant ratio approximation of MWVC was published by Bar-Yehuda and Even in 1981 \cite{Bar-Yehuda:1981lr}. Gonzalez created a 2-optimal LP-Free linear time algorithm based on Maximal Matching in 1995 which is the basis of our distributed algorithm \cite{Gonzalez1995129}. 

We are aware of two prior distributed algorithms for minimum weighted vertex cover. Grandoni et. al present a 2-optimal algorithm based on maximal matching in 2008\cite{1435381}. This algorithm uses $O(\log n + \hat{W})$ communication rounds, where $\hat{W}$ is the average vertex weight, and $n$ is the number of vertexes. Koufogiannakis and Young present a simpler $O(\log n)$ algorithm in 2009 \cite{1582746}.
In this section we'll talk about prior work.
