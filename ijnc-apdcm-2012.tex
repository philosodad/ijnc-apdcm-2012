\begin{abstract}
We present an automata for a compute node in a message passing model which allows a distributed computer to approximate solutions for three NP-Complete graph problems. Our algorithm for the Vertex Cover Problem uses $O(\log{\Delta)}$ communication rounds to find a 2-approximate solution. Our edge coloring algorithm is also 2-approximate and resolves in $O(\Delta)$ rounds, and we find a correct strong edge coloring of a symmetric digraph in $O(\Delta)$ rounds. All three algorithms require only one hop information to find correct solutions.

\section{Introduction}

In this paper we expand on our prior work in \cite{Daigle:2011uq, Daigle:2012uq} using a simple Matching Automata to find constant approximations for NP-complete problems on a message passing computer. We present both theoretical and experimental results. We improve on our prior work in two ways, first, we improve our proof for correctness and performance, second, we present expanded experimental results, and third, we present an improved algorithm for edge color.

\section{The Vertex Cover Problem}

In this section we'll present the findings for Vertex Cover.

\subsection{Algorithm}

\subsection{Analysis}

\label{ssb:algorithms-dgmm-performance}

Despite its overall simplicity, Algorithm~\ref{alg:dgmm} has a running time of $O(\log \Delta)$, which improves on the previous best result of $O(\log n)$ in \cite{1582746} without sacrificing the performance bound of two-optimality. A formal proof of our performance claims follows.

\section{Edge Coloring Problem}

In this section we'll present the approach for edge coloring.

\subsection{Distance 1 Algorithm}
\subsubsection{Description}
\input{algs/alg-edge-color}
\input{secs/sec-dimaed-description}
\subsubsection{Analysis}
We here address the termination, correctness, and solution quality of Algorithm~\ref{alg:edge-color}. We will first show that Algorithm~\ref{alg:edge-color} is likely to terminate in $O(\Delta)$ rounds, then that it will produce a correct coloring if it does terminate, and finally that the coloring produced will use no more than $2\Delta - 1$ colors.

\subsubsection{Experimental Results}

In our experimental results, we found that graph structure was a crucial component in determining the quality of solution that we found in any of our algorithms.
