\begin{defi}[Edge Coloring]
\label{def:ec}
An edge coloring of a graph is an assignment of colors to the edges of a graph in such a way that no two adjacent edges are assigned the same color. 

Formally, given a graph, $G(V,E)$, and set of colors $C$, an edge coloring of $G$ is a mapping $f(e) = E \mapsto C \suchthat \forall\, e(u,v), e'(v,w) \in E, c \in C, f(e) = c \implies f(e') \ne c$.
