\begin{defi}[Strong Directed Edge Coloring]

A strong edge coloring is an assignment of colors to the edges of the graph such that no two edges that can be connected by a common edge are assigned the same color. 

In the directed case, a strong edge coloring is a mapping $f(e) = C \mapsto E \suchthat \forall\, e(u,v), e'(v,u), e''(w,v), e'''(w,x) \in E, c \in C, f(e) = c \implies f(e') \ne c, f(e'') \ne c, f(e''') \ne c$.
