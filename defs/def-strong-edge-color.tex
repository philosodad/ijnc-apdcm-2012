\begin{defi}[Strong Edge Coloring]

A strong edge coloring of a graph is an assignment of colors to the edges of a graph such that no two edges that can be connected by a common edge are assigned the same color. 

Formally, given a graph $G(V,E)$ and a set of colors $C$, a strong edge coloring is a mapping $f(e) = C \mapsto E \suchthat \forall\, e(u,v), e'(v,w), e''(w,x) \in E, c \in C, f(e) = c \implies f(e') \ne c \wedge f(e'') \ne c$
