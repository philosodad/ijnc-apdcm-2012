\subsubsection{Minimum Vertex Cover (MVC)}
\label{sub:mvc}
Given an undirected Graph $G(V,E)$, a {\em Vertex Cover} of $G$ is a set of vertices $V'$ such that for each edge $e_{u,v} \in E$, $u \in V'$ or $v \in V'$. The Minimum Vertex Cover Problem is to find the smallest possible vertex cover of $G$.

\subsubsection{Minimum Weighted Vertex Cover (MWVC)}
\label{sub:mwvc}
Given an undirected Graph $G(V,E)$, where each $v \in V$ has a positive weight $w(v)$, minimize $\sum_{v \in V'} w(v)$.

%\subsubsection{Minimum (Weighted) Vertex Cover of a Hypergraph}

%Given a Hypergraph $G(V,E)$, with vertices $v \in V$ and hyperedges $e_{v_1...v_n}$, a vertex cover of $G$ is a set $V'\: | \: \forall e \in E,\quad \exists v \in V'\: |\: v \in e$. The minimum vertex cover and minimum weighted vertex cover are as described in sections~\ref{sub:mvc} and ~\ref{sub:mwvc}
